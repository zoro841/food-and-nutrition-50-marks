  <h1>Food and Nutrition</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Malnutrition</h2>
    <p>Malnutrition refers to a condition where the body does not receive adequate nutrients for proper functioning. It includes both undernutrition and overnutrition. Undernutrition results in weight loss, stunted growth, and weakened immunity. Overnutrition, on the other hand, leads to obesity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart problems. Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable. Lack of variety in diet often causes micronutrient deficiencies. Malnutrition weakens the body, making recovery from illness slower. It also affects brain development, learning ability, and productivity. People living in poverty or in areas with food insecurity are at higher risk. Cultural practices and food taboos can also lead to poor nutrition. Treating malnutrition involves both immediate care and long-term food and health solutions. Nutrition education, food aid, and government support are key tools to reduce its impact. Combating malnutrition helps individuals grow, learn, and live healthy lives.
    </p>

    <h2>Causes of Malnutrition</h2>
    <p>Several factors can lead to malnutrition. One major cause is poverty, which limits access to sufficient and nutritious food. Lack of education often leads to poor food choices and unhealthy habits. Natural disasters or conflict can disrupt food supply. Illnesses like diarrhea, infections, or parasites reduce the body’s ability to absorb nutrients. Poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water also contribute to nutrient loss. Unbalanced diets and eating disorders can also cause deficiencies. Cultural beliefs and traditions sometimes restrict the intake of nutritious foods. Mental health issues or neglect may lead to poor appetite and food intake. Limited access to healthcare prevents early diagnosis and treatment. In some cases, elderly people suffer from malnutrition due to loneliness or difficulty cooking. Children not breastfed or fed inappropriate food are at higher risk. Food deserts, where healthy food is unavailable, worsen the problem. Education, clean water, and better health services can prevent many of these causes.

    <h2>Diseases Related to Malnutrition</h2>
    <p>Malnutrition can lead to several serious diseases. Anemia occurs when the body lacks enough iron to make red blood cells. This causes fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Kwashiorkor and marasmus are two protein-energy malnutrition disorders found in children. Kwashiorkor causes swollen belly and thin limbs, while marasmus leads to extreme weight loss. Rickets, caused by vitamin D deficiency, results in soft and weak bones in children. Goiter is the swelling of the thyroid gland due to iodine deficiency. Pellagra, caused by lack of niacin (vitamin B3), results in diarrhea, skin rashes, and mental disturbances. Scurvy is a vitamin C deficiency that leads to bleeding gums and poor wound healing. Beriberi, from thiamine deficiency, affects nerves and the heart. Zinc deficiency weakens immunity and slows growth in children. These diseases are preventable through proper diet, supplements, and education. Regular health checkups can help detect and treat them early.

    <h2>Nutrition and Balanced Diet</h2>
    <p>Nutrition is the science of how food nourishes the body. A balanced diet contains appropriate proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates provide energy for daily activities. Proteins are essential for growth, tissue repair, and enzyme production. Fats help in hormone production and store energy. Vitamins like A, B, C, D, E, and K support various body functions such as vision, immunity, and blood clotting. Minerals such as iron, calcium, and potassium support bone health, oxygen transport, and nerve function. Water is essential for digestion, temperature control, and eliminating waste. A balanced diet should include a variety of food from all food groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and proteins. Eating seasonal and local foods increases freshness and nutrient value. Overeating or undereating any group causes imbalance. Meal planning, moderation, and variety are key to a healthy life. Balanced diets prevent disease and improve mental and physical well-being.

    <h2>Food Selection and Preservation</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right food is crucial for good health. One should select fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Look for foods that are brightly colored, firm, and free from cuts or mold. Reading nutrition labels can help choose healthier options. Foods should be stored properly to prevent spoilage. For example, refrigerating dairy products and meats slows bacterial growth. Preservation techniques such as drying, freezing, canning, and pickling extend shelf life. Natural preservation methods like sun drying or fermenting can retain nutrients and flavor. Avoid overstocking perishable items to reduce waste. Washing produce before storage removes pesticides and dirt. Airtight containers prevent moisture and pests. Avoid using chemical preservatives where possible. Always check expiration dates on packaged items. Proper preservation not only keeps food safe but also reduces economic waste and foodborne diseases. Making wise food choices daily helps maintain a balanced diet and protect family health.

    <h2>Food Constituents</h2>
    <p>Food contains various nutrients that play specific roles in the body. Carbohydrates, such as rice, bread, and potatoes, are the body’s main energy source. Proteins, found in meat, eggs, beans, and nuts, are essential for building and repairing tissues. Fats provide energy and help absorb vitamins; healthy fats come from nuts, seeds, and fish. Vitamins support bodily functions: vitamin A helps vision, vitamin C strengthens the immune system, and vitamin D supports bone health. Minerals such as iron, calcium, and potassium are vital for blood production, strong bones, and muscle function. Water regulates body temperature, aids digestion, and removes waste. Fiber, though not a nutrient, aids digestion and prevents constipation. Each constituent has a unique role, and no single food provides all. That’s why it’s important to eat a variety. Overconsumption or deficiency of any nutrient can cause health problems. Understanding food constituents helps in making nutritious choices every day.

    <h2>Preserving Nutrients in Cooking</h2>
    <p>Cooking methods can greatly affect the nutrient content of food. Overcooking vegetables, especially boiling them in lots of water, leads to vitamin loss. To preserve nutrients, use cooking methods like steaming, grilling, or stir-frying. Cutting vegetables into large pieces reduces nutrient loss. Using less water and cooking for shorter durations helps retain vitamins like C and B. Cooking with the lid on traps steam and heat, speeding up cooking and protecting nutrients. Using leftover water from steamed or boiled vegetables in soups or sauces recycles nutrients. Avoid soaking vegetables for long periods before cooking. Reheating food multiple times also reduces nutrient quality. Microwaving can be a safe and quick way to preserve nutrients if done correctly. Cooking with minimal oil and seasoning preserves natural flavors and health value. By being mindful of cooking methods, families can maintain the nutritional value of their meals and stay healthy.

    <h2>Preventing Malnutrition</h2>
    <p>Preventing malnutrition starts with awareness and education. Individuals should be taught about the importance of eating balanced meals. Governments and schools can provide mid-day meals to ensure children get proper nutrition. Breastfeeding infants and introducing safe, nutritious foods early helps prevent child malnutrition. Regular health checkups can detect early signs of nutrient deficiencies. Encouraging hygiene, such as handwashing and safe food preparation, prevents illness that affects nutrient absorption. Clean drinking water reduces risk of diarrhea and dehydration. Fortifying foods like flour or salt with vitamins and minerals helps reach larger populations. Communities can grow kitchen gardens to increase food availability. Vaccination and deworming reduce disease burden and improve nutrition. Food relief and support during crises ensure food access for all. Nutrition counseling, especially for mothers and caregivers, is crucial. Preventing malnutrition promotes strong immunity, healthy growth, and better academic and work performance.

    <h2>Food Adulteration</h2>
    <p>Food adulteration is the act of adding harmful or inferior substances to food items. It is done to increase quantity or shelf life but reduces food quality and safety. Common adulterants include chalk powder in flour, water in milk, and colored substances in spices. Consuming adulterated food can lead to serious health problems such as food poisoning, organ damage, and even cancer. It affects people’s health slowly and often goes unnoticed. Adulterants like lead or mercury are highly toxic and may affect brain development in children. Buying food from reliable sources and checking for certifications like FSSAI can help avoid adulterated products. Simple home tests like rubbing turmeric on white paper can detect chalk powder. Government agencies conduct inspections, but public awareness is key. Food laws and punishments for adulterators must be strict. Educating consumers helps them make safer choices. Safe food is a right, and fighting adulteration ensures a healthy nation.
